Ferrell Takes the Field	Looking to match the record of baseball great Bert Campaneris (and to amiably screw around for an hour), Will Ferrell sets out to play all nine positions for ten different, very obliging major league teams in a single spring training day. If the concept of Ferrell pulling the legendary “conceptual comedy Plimpton” isn’t enough to amuse you, then the fact that all proceeds of this HBO special are going to fight cancer might earn a few charitable laughs. But, considering how Ferrell’s commitment to oddball projects has paid off over the years, you can probably count on laughing for real and donating your unused pity laughs to the cause.

Everything Is Copy	Jacob Bernstein's extremely entertaining film is a tribute to his mother Nora Ephron: Hollywood-raised daughter of screenwriters who grew up to be an ace reporter turned piercingly funny essayist turned novelist/screenwriter/playwright/director. Ephron comes vibrantly alive onscreen via her words; the memories of her sisters, colleagues, former spouses, and many friends; scenes from her movies; and, above all, her own inimitable presence. Watch any given moment of Ephron being her sparkling but caustically witty self (for instance, this response to a scolding talk show host—"You have a soft spot for Julie Nixon, don't you. See, I don't...") and you find it hard to believe that she’s been gone from our midst for three years. Everything Is Copy (Ephron's motto, inherited from her mother) is a lovingly drawn but frank portrait and, incidentally, a vivid snapshot of an earlier, livelier, bitchier, and funnier moment in New York culture.	2015-09-29	0.0

Mad Max: Black & Chrome	Mad Max: Fury Road is a masterpiece, but we’ve never seen the best version of the film, at least according to director George Miller. In his mind, a black and white version of the post-apocalyptic car opera with the score making the only sounds in the film would be best. And so, the Blu-ray release of Fury Road was to include that cut. But it never came, even though Miller reportedly demanded its release from Warner Bros. Today is then indeed a lovely day, as one dedicated fan has taken it upon themselves to realize Miller’s vision. The creator of this black and white cut drained the color out of the orange dunes, azure sky, and crimson blood. Gunshots and dialogue have been replaced with remixed versions of the film’s score. It may not be what Miller himself would have done, but it’s still an incredible watch. Witness “Black &amp; Chrome”.	2015-09-21	7.5

Occidente	“Filming in Lisbon in search of the origins of our colonial history, I found copies. Brazilians, the new worlders fluent in glitz, entertain the Portuguese in awe and discomfort, colonial norms applied and reapplied. Chinese porcelain seem to signal hybrids to come: the Chinese dressed as Europeans, the Brazilian maid dressed as a 19th-century European servant. Porcelain from the 15th-century becomes reproducible ready-mades that set the tables for the new colonies—a transatlantic calling. Ouro novo reads new money. As a poem without periods, as a breath without breathing, the voyage travels eastward and westward, marking cycles of expansion in a struggle to find one’s place, one’s seat at the table.”—Ana Vaz	2015-09-15	0.0

Sobytie	In August 1991 a failed coup d'état attempt (known as Putsch) led by a group of hard-core communists in Moscow, ended the 70-year-long rule of the Soviets. The USSR collapsed soon after, and the tricolour of the sovereign Russian Federation flew over Kremlin. As president Gorbachev was detained by the coup leaders, state-run TV and radio channels, usurped by the putschists, broadcast Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake" instead of news bulletins, and crowds of protestors gathered around Moscow's White House, preparing to defend the stronghold of democratic opposition led by Boris Yeltsin, in the city of Leningrad thousands of confused, scared, excited and desperate people poured into the streets to become a part of the event, which was supposed to change their destiny. A quarter of a century later, Sergei Loznitsa revisits the dramatic moments of August 1991 and casts an eye on the event which was hailed worldwide as the birth of "Russian democracy".	2015-09-02	0.0
